# Questionnaires, surveys
Surveys increase audience reach and user engagement. With the help of polls, you get important information and show customers that you are interested in their opinion. And quantitatively test the hypothesis.
When is a survey used?
- When we understand how a user can solve problems, what tools to use, about barriers, and so on. That is, when we know where to think.
- Formation of a user profile and further segmentation, distribution of geos and strata.

1. Questions should be concise, understandable and to the point. Mostly closed. Open to problematic and deep.
2. Answers should reflect the opinion of the user as much as possible. All job stories. Do not suggest and impose an opinion
3. An interesting and relevant topic, storytelling.
4. Ask about the past, not about the possible future 5. Be generous with rewardsJ

# A/B - tests
A/B test gives the most transparent result
One time
The same traffic (not by groups) Same success/failure metrics
One hypothesis
One experiment

When to use an A/B test
When there are development resources and it is inexpensive to launch
When there is analytics in the product
When a hypothesis is tested against metrics
When when you need to check for sure and no longer guess

# MVP launch
When is MVP used?
When a use case is being tested (working/non-working) When a ruble check is needed
When can specific hypotheses be tested?

# collection of the semantic core
When is semantic research applied?
When it is not clear what to look for, but it can be clear in which direction When a quick check is possible without involving people

# Clustering feedback comments
By keywords
By user segments By call service
We use it when there are comments, feedback in any form

# Corridor testing
Phone calls
• Questions by mail
• Poll on the street
1) Introduce yourself as a product product (if the product is not known, you can always introduce yourself as a VkontakteJ product)
2) Prepare a question script with multiple choice answers
3) Set it in a convenient format for everyone / target audience
We use
• when there are many open-ended questions
• when the segment is only palpated
