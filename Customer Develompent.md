# Intro
The sad thing that people that like your product will not necessary be the people who will pay for the product. You may get a lot of compliments or free users but that won’t pay your teams electricity bills or buy any food. Not to starve to death you would actually need to have the users paying you.
# Process
- Customer discovery
- Customer validation
- Customer creation
- Company building

this is testing an idea or a prototype of a future product on potential consumers, that is, a client-oriented approach to creating a business. According to this concept, the product must necessarily solve the problem of the client. According to the Lean Startup methodology, first the problem is identified, then the product is developed, and not vice versa.

# Problem Interview
When do we use the problem interview?
1. There is no way to collect quantitative data. This happens if a new product is created or an idea of ​​new functionality appears in an existing one. And also if the audience of the product is new and not yet studied.
2. Quantitative data collected but not helping to test the hypothesis. For example, they provide too little information about how and why users act.
3. If you have never seen users or have not seen users for more than several months, then it's time. Communication during the interview will help to understand how they live, what worries them, what is important and valuable.
The goal is to find out:
Is there a problem?
How does the client formulate it?
How does the client evaluate the problem?
How does he solve this problem now?
How attractive is the client segment for business?

Template
1. How are you currently dealing with need X? How much do you pay in total for this? 
2. Are you satisfied with how you are filling need X? Not really? Tell me more! 
3. What happens if you can't solve need X? What will you do?
4. With your current solution, what gives you the most inconvenience? What emotion did you experience while solving the problem?
5. Please tell us about the last time you faced these difficulties. How often do you encounter this difficulty?
6. Why was it hard? Rate from 0 to 10 how difficult it was (where 10 is the strongest emotion in life)
7. How would you solve the need differently? If your solution existed, would you be willing to pay for it right now?
(+ here you can try to conduct a decision interview on the proposed solution, if it has already been worked out product-wise).
8. What did I not ask about, but I should have?

Other
- How much are you willing to pay for our solution?
- How much money are you losing because of this problem, do you have a budget for this direction?
- How much are you willing to pay for ours Tell us how you faced this problem last time and how you solved it

The order of the script formation
1. Select hypotheses to test 
2. 2. Develop scenarios 
3. 3. Decide where we take our target audience 
4. 4. Fix the results
5. We analyze the results
6. We adjust the script based on the results of each interview

What do you need to remember?
- From the start, let the person understand that you are not going to sell him anything, otherwise he will be closed and tensely waiting for your sweet speeches.
- If different people have similar problems in a certain area, supplement your interview script with clarifications on these similar problems. The script is polished almost always along the way.
- Five "why?". We ask this question until we get to the bottom of the cause or emotion.
- Three repetitions. We ask the same question several times in different contexts: the patterns of behavior of the same person in different conditions can be very different.
- Get insights. Communication with users usually opens the eyes to things that the product does not even think about before.

How much and how to spend?
40 - for a complex and unknown need and segment.
20 - for a not very complex need and a moderately understandable segment.
10 - for an understandable segment.

Do's
You need to ask potential customers about facts, existing problems and needs (hypotheses should be thought out for them in advance)
How the client solves this problem now (and whether he solves it at all), whether he was looking for a solution to his problem or whether he tried to satisfy his need, how much money (money, time) he spends on solving the problem
How big is this problem for the client (if clients have a small problem once a year - isn't it obvious that no one will pay you?)

and Don'ts
You can’t talk about your idea (otherwise the person will not want to upset you and most likely will lie)
“But if there was such a solution”, “Will you buy it”, “Will you solve your problem if I create solution X” - all these questions do not oblige you to anything, it will not cost anything for the interlocutor to say “yes ' to seem better and not upset you

During the conversation, and depending on what consumers say, I ask clarifying questions that require a detailed answer. Here are some examples. Can you elaborate on the process? Who is involved in the decision-making? When was the last time you did ______, how long did it take you? Where do you usually buy ______? Tell us how you came to this conclusion?
All people are different, but the laws of psychology are universal. We are all motivated by three things: we enjoy helping others;
we like to appear smart;
we like to solve problems.

To get the customer talking, ask the top five customer development questions, then move on to follow-up questions.
Ask questions that require a detailed answer so that clients are not limited to superficial reasoning.
Find out what customers are doing today. Their today's behavior is your competence. Go up one level to see the problem in a broader context. Focus not on the future, but on today's behavior of the client. Don't ask if he's going to do something. Refer to the recent past and ask the client to tell when and how they did it last time or how many times they did it in the last month.
Be wary of the client's mental blocks (he may not perceive the problem as such; think that it cannot be solved; perhaps he is limited in resources or afraid to violate sociocultural prohibitions). Ask questions to help clear the "block".

Key Recommendations
1. Ask only open-ended questions
2. Try to reduce all questions to testing a hypothesis
3. Try to validate the segment with questions (only the wealthy will use the expensive service, etc.)
4. Do not ask about the decision and the future
