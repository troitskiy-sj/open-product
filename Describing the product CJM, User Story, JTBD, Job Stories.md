# Intro
There are a lot of ways to describe what needs to be done. Try not to over focus on the frameworks but rather talk with the team and figure out what suits best for them. In the end you are not on the exam to do everything by the book, you are serving your team to do their best.

# Frameworks:
- Jobs to be done
- User stories
- Just notes
