# Intro
# Segmentation classic - by purchases
1. Active payer. It may vary from service to service, but usually this is a user who uses the application regularly and has recently made a purchase (at least 30 days ago), or more than one.
2. Active defaulter. This is a user who actively uses the application, but has never made a purchase.
3. Sleeping payer. Once upon a time, the user made a purchase (more than 30 days ago), but now he either abandoned the application, or sometimes uses it, but does not pay.
4. Inactive defaulter. The largest user base of any user base for any application. Almost or nothing done in the app. The most difficult to reach for retargeting. For the price, it can cost as much as attracting a new one.
