# Intro
# Backlog
1. The Scrum Guide does not say exactly how the completed tasks get into the product backlog. This is the problem that discovery sprints solve.
2. Not only that, well-developed tasks get into the backlog. It is important that well-founded initiatives get into the backlog. 3. We engage and engage the team early, reducing risk and increasing engagement.
4. In development sprints, the designer, analyst often do not participate or play an episodic role. It happens that the designer and the analyst are not involved in the development of problems. Now they are full participants in the process.
5. When choosing solutions and problems, alternatives are systematically considered, and the first solution that comes across is not taken.
6. The backlog is replenished systematically and regularly with the most important things, and not with what has to be.
7. Products do not dig into details, but systematically work on discovery items. The metric for success is the number of valid initiatives per sprint.
