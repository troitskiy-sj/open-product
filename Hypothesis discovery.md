# Intro
Just wrap your mind around it, you can’t know what will happen. Everything is just an educated guess. Having more information doesn’t always help but comes handy from time to time.
# Template
- When___(situation)I want to___(motivation)So I can___(expected outcome)
- We believe [doing this], for [these people], will achieve [this outcome/impact]. We will test it by 1, 2, 3. We will know the hypothesis is valid if by [date], we get [quantitive measurable outcome1, quantitive measurable outcome2]

# Process
1. We are looking for an answer to the question: what are the strategic tasks we face, who influences the company, what are our priorities;
2. We collect everything that is known on the topic: it can be both facts and assumptions; 
3. We formulate a hypothesis about a possible way to solve the problem. Remember: the point is not to come up with a hypothesis, but to make it qualitative.
Qualitative hypothesis:
- You can check - and there are certain criteria
- Can be quantified - impact on a specific metric - Unobvious - refutation - not a fail
- Has competitors / analogues / antipodes
Hypothesis example:
+ Unavailable products in the storefront increase the conversion to the purchase of the entire site / application by 10%
+ Recommendations for the user stimulate sales only for active users. For new ones, it is better to offer the TOP products that new users buy on the site.
# Questions
+ What problem are we going to solve?
+ Is this problem really important for target consumer segments?
+ Are they willing to pay for/invest in solving this problem?
+ If you are ready, then why will they pay you? How much and how are you willing to pay?

# Outside sources of hypothesis
- Merry Miker 
- Gartner Hype cycle
- Industry leading blogs
- Industry research by marketing agencies
- Press releases
- Statistics aggregators
- Gartner magic quadrant
- Product hunt like websites
- Startup accelerators
- Investment reports
- Public figures in your industry
- What your competitors do
- What features their users want
- what does competitors from other niches that fit you doing
- Conferences, forums, reddit
- what features yours users ask for

# Inside sources of hypothesis
- what people do inside of your product
- what customers that stopped using your product say
- what your team and other company members say
- what do company leaders, inverstors say
- what other teams are doing
- use your own product - eat your own dog food

# Before adding to the backlog
1. From external and internal sources of information, we formulate measurable, non-obvious, testable hypotheses. The main thing is what metrics the product/feature will affect.
2. For hypotheses, we make a structured prioritized backlog of hypotheses.
3. For the highest priorities, we make an Impact map, consider the business model and the product market (according to the Osterwald model)
4. For the most understandable and business-interesting, we do express validation (as part of interviews, surveys, launching a minimum working product)
5. We collect feedback and develop a full-fledged product (+ design sprints). We launch products/features that have successfully passed validation.
6. We reflect on each stage.
