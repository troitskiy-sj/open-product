# Intro
There are a lot of ways to think about it. Generally a Product Manager is the one doing all the stuff for the product. When you do not have a business analyst — you do the requirements. When you do not have a marketing manager you will do the campaigns. When you do not have a developer — you will do the coding. So think of a Product Manager as a founder of a software service/product that does some particular things so that the user pays him something.
