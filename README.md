# Intro
This is an open course on Product Managment. You can contribute to this project if you find anything useful for example or if you want to add something from your experience.
# How to contribute
This course is made of .md files, which are markdown files. You can use any editor. I personally use AI Writer on my mac to edit it and then use Github desktop to push it to Github.
## Ways to contribute:
	- You can add the changes you want to make and create a pull request
	- You can add an issue and I will add something myself
	- You can go to the community tab and add the topic
	- You can share the project with your friends and star it for yourself too
