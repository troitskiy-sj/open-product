# Intro
There are a lot of ways to describe what needs to be done. Try not to over focus on the frameworks but rather talk with the team and figure out what suits best for them. In the end you are not on the exam to do everything by the book, you are serving your team to do their best.

# Frameworks:
- Jobs to be done
- User stories
- Just notes
- BPMN Diagrams
- Just flow charts
- CJM (customer journey map)
- JTBD (jobs to be done)
- Job Stories
- Mockups

# Structuring the information
- Clustering by two indicators
- Clustering by more than two indicators
- Impact mapping

# CJM
CJM is best used when you have a good idea of who your user is. For example, you have a good selection of data. All this is necessary to correctly compose a person. After all, if the persona is drawn up incorrectly, then you will misunderstand the motivation and problems of users.
If you can't make up a persona, then you'd better use Jobs to be done. There, the emphasis is not on the person, but on what the user wants to achieve.

• Stages (cold call, store entrance, ...)
• Goals of buyers (buy the most delicious fruit, ...)
• Customer expectations (what the user expects at the touchpoints)
• Points of contact (advertising, search engines, social networks...)
• Description of the process (what exactly happens to the client)
• Screenshots (actions, clicks...)
• Emotions (what emotions the user experiences)
• Quotes (direct speech of the user)
• Experience (what kind of experience does the user get?)
• Barriers (uncomfortable, unclear where to press...)
• Description of benefits
• Insights (what we, as products, understood by looking at user behavior)
• Persons (who is our user)

# JTB
As Peter Drucker wrote, "The customer rarely buys what the business sells to him."
Don't focus on your product or solution - focus on "jobs" (user problems) and help the user move them from "to be done" status to "done" status - and make his life a little easier and more comfortable .

The theory is based on 3 statements:
1. People don't buy products, they buy the best version of themselves (progress)
2. Context determines a person's choice
3. Products are "hired" and "fired" when they no longer work better than others
We describe:
a) how the task to be done arises
b) how consumers will behave when they have this task.
To do this, we use the following data: 1. Unsatisfied desires
2. Restrictions
3. Catalysts
4. Choice options.

Jobs to be Done is a theory about user behavior that helps understand how and why people make their first purchase decision.
The point of the theory is that people do not buy products, but "hire" them to perform certain tasks.
“I don't buy a lawn mower because I need a lawn mower. I need a beautiful lawn, and in a broader sense, a beautiful yard, so that all the neighbors ooh and aah, passing by my garden.

# User Stories
A User Story is a short statement of intent that describes what the product is supposed to do for the user.
User Story is not a requirement.
For example: Like, <user role/character>, I <want to get something>, <for such and such a purpose>.
As a consumer, I find it convenient to search for books by genre to quickly find the ones I love to read.
As a consumer, when I select books to buy, I want to put each one in the basket at once. As a product launch manager, I want to be able to track our customers' purchases so I know what books to offer them.

Opt for breaking your story down into smaller chunks instead of one big one.
• Avoid technical jargon in stories whenever possible—especially if
subsequently, your business users will need to prioritize the stories.
• Avoid discussing specific UI elements. History must stay relevant
even if the visual implementation changes.
• Be sure to evaluate story development efforts.
• The story should lead to a clear and valuable result.

# Job stories
1. Start with a high-level task
For example, help the seller to arrange a loan together with the buyer. Usually the client has to fill out a lot of paperwork.
2. Identify one or more smaller problems or one that would help solve the problem at a level higher
To apply for a loan, the seller and the buyer must fill out a lot of paperwork: car information, loan terms and other data that can be quite “intimate”. The client will want to be sure that his financial information is confidential and secure.
3. Watch how people solve a given problem now
Before providing their data, the buyer usually evaluates by eye whether the dealership and its employees can be trusted. And after making sure, he fills out the papers under the supervision of the seller and without witnesses
4. Formulate one or more Job Stories
Interacting with the seller through the app...
...the buyer will want to know that the company and its employees can be trusted and the checkout process is secure.
The seller will want to be sure that the checkout process will not make the customer nervous...
...so that he does not doubt whether it is worth transferring his data to the seller.
5. Formulate a decision
Add a new feature or make changes to the interface so that the story resolves in the way you want.
profile and how it should look. It was important to strike a balance: a lack of information would not allow solving the problem, and an excess could lead to negative effects. The discussion led to the following conclusions:
The client should always see the seller's profile in the application, as if he is nearby. This will reduce the level of anxiety.
The profile should contain a photo of the seller, his position and information about how long he has been with the company and how many cars he has sold. This will help the client to trust the employee.
The profile must contain contact information for contacting the seller. In addition to the phone and mail, you need an "Ask a question [seller]" button. This will give the client the opportunity to make sure that he correctly filled out all the documents.
